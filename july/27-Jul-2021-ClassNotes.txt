Last Session : First Application Development Completed Using Data JPA

Today's Session : Spring Data JPA Internals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Spring Data JPA came into market to simplify CRUD operations in the application.

-> Before Data JPA, we used to write lot of boiler plate code to perform Crud Operations.

-> Data JPA Provided Repository interfaces to perform CRUD operations.

		1) CrudRepository
		2) JpaRepository

-> If our interface extend properties from any one of above repository then our interface will get methods to perform Crud operations.


public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<T, ID>{

}

-> First Argument Represents Entity Class
-> Second Argument Represents DataType of Primary Key

Note: @Repository is optional.
