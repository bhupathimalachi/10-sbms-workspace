-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> In last session we discussed about internals of run ( ) method.

-> run ( ) method is performing bootstrapping process for spring boot application.

-> After completion of bootstrapping run ( ) method will return ConfigurableApplicationContext.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> When our application started, SpringApplication class will be loaded and its constructor will be executed.

-> In SpringApplication class constructor they are calling deduceFromClassPath( ) method. This method is responsible to identify what type of boot application we have created.

-> In Spring Boot we can create below 3 types of applications

			1) Reactive Application
			2) Web Servlet Application
			3) Default Application

-> Based on starters we configure in pom.xml it will identify what type of project it is.


	spring-boot-starter-webflux =====> Reactive App
	spring-boot-starter-web =========> Web Servlet App
	spring-boot-starter =============> Standalone Application

-> Based on type of the application boot will identify the configuration which is required and it will provide that configuration.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> In Spring framework we will create IOC container using below approaches

BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory (Resource res);
ApplicationContext ctxt = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(String loc);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Programmer no need to create IOC container in Spring Boot.

-> In Spring Boot IOC creation will be taken care by run ( )

-> In Spring Boot, based on our application type IOC will be created.
